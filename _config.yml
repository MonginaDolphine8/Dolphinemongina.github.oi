  My name is Dolphine Mongina 
  <br><br>
With more than 3 years of experience in geospatial and statistical analysis, she has become an expert in the application of Geospatial Information Systems and Remote Sensing to address challenges in multiple sectors such 
as health, energy, environment, climate, agriculture, and finance. She has also worked on developing the award-winning vulnerability index which has been crucial in epidemiology to identify locations most at risk of the 
effects of the COVID-19 pandemic for economic recovery plans. 
She has a keen interest in the use of cutting-edge technology to mitigate the adverse effects of climate change which is a major threat to the agricultural sector in developing countries and led strategic conversations 
with key company stalk holders on how best to reduce their carbon emissions while still maintaining the profit margins. She has done extensive research in sizing and situating hydrogen production potential in Africa.
Dolphine holds a Bachelor of Science in Geomatics Engineering and Geospatial Information Systems from Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology (JKUAT)
